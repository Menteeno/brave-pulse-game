### **Assertiveness Board Game**

### **1. Introduction**

"The Balance Game" (بازی تراز) is an interactive, behavioral simulation board game designed to develop the soft skill of **"Assertiveness" (جراتمندی)** in work environments, especially in startup teams.

The main goal of the game is to place players in a high-pressure simulation of everyday work conflicts. Players experience how their behavioral decisions (Passive, Aggressive, or Assertive) directly impact their personal interests and team results.

This game is optimized for **4 players per team** and can be run **competitively between multiple teams** simultaneously. The game is played in **8 rounds** (equivalent to 8 sprints or work situations), and each round focuses on an individual decision and its group impact.

### **2. Game Objective**

The game has two parallel objective levels:

1.  **Team Objective (Competitive):**
    To earn the highest "Project Score" compared to other teams participating in the event. This objective creates competitive dynamics and the need for collaboration to achieve a team result.

2.  **Individual Objective (Survival & Learning):**
    To create a balance between three individual Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Each player must manage the following three indicators:

    * **Self-Respect**
    * **Relationship Health**
    * **Goal Achievement**

**Key Message:** The main challenge of the game is "Strategic Assertiveness." The player must learn how to balance their individual needs (maintaining the 3 KPIs) and the team's needs (earning Project Score) and consciously pay the "cost" of being assertive.

### **3. Game Components**

* **Player Board:** (Per player) A board to track the 3 individual KPIs (Self-Respect, Relationships, Goal).
* **KPI Tokens:** (Per player) 3 tokens that move on the player board (all start at 5 points).
* **Team Board:** (Per team) A simple board to record the team's "Project Score."
* **Reaction Cards:** (Per player) 3 fixed cards that are always in front of the player:
    1.  [Passive Card] Gray
    2.  [Aggressive Card] Orange
    3.  [Assertive Card] Green
    The backs of all cards are black (for example).
* **Situation Cards:** (One deck per team) Cards that describe challenging startup scenarios and determine team outcomes.

### **4. Key Rules & Mechanics**

These mechanics form the psychological core of the game:

**A) Decision Mechanic (3 Fixed Cards):**

In each round, the player always has access to all three behavioral options. The game is based on conscious choice, not luck. The individual costs and benefits are written directly on the cards:

**1. Playing [Passive]:**

* Individual Benefit: +1 [Relationship Health] (Because you avoided conflict)
* Individual Cost: -1 [Self-Respect] (Because you ignored your own needs)

**2. Playing [Aggressive]:**

* Individual Benefit: +1 [Goal Achievement] (Because you got what you wanted by force)
* Individual Cost: -1 [Relationship Health] (Because you harmed others)

**3. Playing [Assertive]:**

* Individual Benefit: +1 [Self-Respect] and +1 [Goal Achievement] (The optimal combination)
* Individual Cost: -1 from any KPI the player chooses. (Simulating the "cost of mental energy"; the player must decide which personal resource to deplete). (Crucial note)

**B) "Burnout Mechanic":**

This mechanic creates the main semi-cooperative tension.

* If *any* of a player's 3 individual KPIs reaches **zero** at any moment, that player experiences "Burnout."
* The team immediately receives a **-10 Project Score** penalty.
* (The player's KPI returns to 1 so they can continue playing). (Can be improved)

### **5. Game Flow - 8 Sprints**

Each round (sprint) consists of 4 phases:

**1. Situation Phase:**
A "Situation Card" is revealed and read aloud. (Example: "In the demo meeting, your colleague takes credit for a feature that you built.")

**2. Decision Phase:**
Players individually and secretly choose one of their 3 Reaction Cards and place it face down on the table. (This is an individual and non-negotiable decision). The team has 1 minute to think about presenting their behavior. And after that, each person, starting from the right of the card reader, must take three minutes to explain the reaction they chose and how they would show it. (This phase creates tension; some may push for team points, while others are worried about their individual KPIs).

**4. Resolution Phase:**
Cards are revealed simultaneously. Resolution happens in two stages: At the end, the card reader should read the consequences of assertive behavior in each situation.

* **1. Individual Resolution:** Each player *first* applies the individual benefit and cost (according to their card) on their player board.
* **2. Team Resolution:** The facilitator or one of the players calculates the team results (according to the text on the "Situation Card"). (Example: "+5 points for each [Assertive] card, -3 points for each [Passive] card"). The final round score is recorded on the team board.

The game ends after 8 rounds. (In groups of three, in 9 rounds)

### **6. Success & Failure**

* **Team Success (Competitive):** The team that has the highest "Project Score" in the entire hall at the end of 8 rounds wins the event.
* **Individual Success (Learning):** A player who managed to finish the game without "Burnout" and maintained a relative balance in all three of their KPIs.
* **Failure:** A team that earns a negative or very low Project Score due to repeated player burnouts.

### **7. Learning Outcomes**

* **Self-Awareness:** Understanding one's personal behavioral patterns (Do I tend to be passive to maintain "Relationships"?)
* **Trade-off Analysis:** Understanding that every behavioral choice is a psychological "trade-off."
* **Strategic Assertiveness:** Learning that assertiveness is a costly resource and one must consciously decide "where" and "how" to spend it.
* **Personal Resource Management:** Understanding that "Self-Respect" and "Relationship Health" are limited resources that must be managed just like "Goal Achievement."
* **Work-Life Balance:** Simulating the pressure between "team needs" (earning points) and "individual needs" (preventing burnout).

### **8. Facilitator Guide**

* **Game Duration:** 60 to 75 minutes (8 rounds).
* **Suggested Environment:** A competitive event with multiple tables of 4.
* **Facilitation Style:** "Facilitator-lite." The game is designed to run itself.
* **Facilitator Tasks:**
    * **Before the Game (10 minutes):** Clearly explain the rules, especially the "Individual Cost" and "Burnout" mechanics.
    * **During the Game (45 minutes):** Manage round times and update team scores on a central scoreboard to create competitive excitement.
    * **After the Game (15-20 minutes):** (The most important part) Conduct the **Debrief** session. The facilitator should not hover over the tables but should lead a deep discussion at the end.
* **Key Questions for Debrief:**
    * "Look at your individual KPI board. At the end of the game, which of your KPIs has the lowest score? Why do you think that is?"
    * "Was there a moment when you *wanted* to be assertive but *couldn't* (because the cost was too high)?"
    * "How similar was this game to your interactions in your real team?"
    * "In the rounds where you played the **Assertive** card, what priority in your real life did this choice represent?"
    * **Did you feel hidden pressure from your teammates during the discussion phase (to get team points)? How much did this pressure affect your final card choice?**
    * **If your teammate experienced burnout and the team was penalized, how did you feel towards them?**
    * **How similar is your risk-taking with your mental health here to your behaviors in your real work environment?**
    * **Did anyone manage to finish the game with all three KPIs at 7 or higher? (If yes, explain their strategy for the game).**
    * **Review the solo question on your forms again. If you were in that situation in today's game, which card would you choose for your reaction?**

### **9. Customization Recommendations**

* **Custom Situation Cards:** The biggest potential for customization is writing "Situation Cards" based on the real, everyday challenges of your own startup teams.
* **Adjusting Difficulty:** The game can be made harder by changing the starting scores (e.g., starting at 3 instead of 5) or increasing the "Burnout" penalty (e.g., -15 points).

At the very end of the game, have our own chart or scoring metric that is shocking, and for example, reveal a new metric at the end and subtract or add some points to the teams to keep the excitement high even after the game and before the discussion panel.
