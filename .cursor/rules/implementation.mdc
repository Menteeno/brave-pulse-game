## 📜 Project Rules and Guidelines

---

### Project Architecture

The project uses **Next.js** (App Router + TypeScript) with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui**. All code must follow best practices for modular, reusable, and maintainable structure.

#### ✅ Folder Structure:

* **/app** → routes and pages (Next.js App Router)
* **/components** → shared reusable UI components
* **/lib** → utilities and helper functions
* **/locales** → translation files (e.g. `fa/common.json`, `en/common.json`)
* **/styles** → global styles if needed

---

### UI Components & Styling

* Always use **shadcn/ui** components (e.g., **Button**, **Input**, **Drawer**, **Card**, **Sheet**, etc.) whenever possible.
* Avoid using raw HTML elements for UI that already have shadcn equivalents.
* All new visual or interactive elements must be implemented as reusable components inside `/components`.
* Design is **mobile-first**. On desktop, content should appear centered and constrained to mobile width.
* The primary color theme must be **green-500** from Tailwind.
* Maintain consistent spacing, padding, and rounded corners (use shadcn defaults).

---

### Internationalization (i18n)

* All visible text must use **translation keys** instead of hardcoded strings.
* Use `next-i18next` for localization.
* **Example usage**: `t("players.add_button")`, not `"افزودن"`.
* Place translations in `/locales/fa/common.json` and `/locales/en/common.json`.
* Do not mix literal text and keys inside components.
* Do not use direct text in components at all, always use keys and translations.

---

### Code Style & Best Practices

* Always use **TypeScript** and **strong typing** for props and data structures.
* Components must be small, reusable, and self-contained.
* Use **React hooks properly**; avoid prop drilling.
* Prefer **composition** over repetition.
* Use functional naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for helpers).
* Follow **accessibility** best practices (e.g., `aria-labels`, focus states).

---

### Navigation & Behavior

* All pages must be **mobile-first** and optimized for **performance**.
* Use `next/navigation` for page transitions.
* Reusable UI actions (Drawers, Modals, Buttons) must come from the `components` directory.
* Each user interaction (like adding a player) should trigger a clear, visible UI response.

---
## 🧑‍🎨 Avatar Rule

All user or player avatar placeholders must be generated dynamically using the following service:
`https://unavatar.io/{email_address}`

### Requirements:

* Always use **unavatar.io** for avatar sources.
* The avatar must be **circular** in appearance (`rounded-full`).
* Prefer **shadcn/ui** components for displaying avatars.
* If the email address is missing or invalid, use a generic fallback URL such as `https://unavatar.io/placeholder`.
* Do **not** use local static assets or external libraries for avatars unless explicitly required.
